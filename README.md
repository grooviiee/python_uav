"# rl" 


My first python simulater implementation.


Implementation course:
1. Deep Learning -> v
2. Q-learning -> v
3. Deep Q-learning -> on going
3. REINFORCE -> on going
4. Actor-critic
5. DDPG

Implementing MultiAgent-PPO
Next step) Attention based actor-critic
Next step) Graph based Attention Actor Critic

Far Next step) Consider transformer based Reinforcement learning method. (Can this method be the trend?)
Transformer를 적용해서 디자인한 RL 알고리즘: "Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling"
https://hugrypiggykim.com/2022/03/29/decision-transformer-reinforcement-learning-via-sequence-modeling/ 에 해당 논문에 대한 설명이 있다.
이를 참고해서 공부해볼 것
