"# rl" 


My first python simulater implementation.


Implementation course:
1. Deep Learning -> v
2. Q-learning -> v
3. Deep Q-learning -> on going
3. REINFORCE -> on going
4. Actor-critic
5. DDPG

Implementing MultiAgent-PPO
Next step) Attention based actor-critic
Next step) Graph based Attention Actor Critic

Far Next step) Consider transformer based Reinforcement learning method. (It's the trend)
